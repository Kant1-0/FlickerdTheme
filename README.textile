h1. Flickerd ZenPhoto Theme

Flickerd is a *"ZenPhoto":zen_url Theme* that is based off of the "Flickrish Theme":flickrish_url 
hosted on Google Code.
It integrates a photo stream similar to Flickr.com and implements a similar design as well.
It is still being developed and I hope to be able to add new features soon.

The *Flickerd Theme* is licensed under the "MIT License":http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php .

h2. Usage

Refer to ZenPhoto's documentation on how to add and use themes.  It works just like a normal theme does.

h2. Feedback

implimented at a later date.
