#(2016 Fork for Zenphoto version 1.4.11) Flickerd ZenPhoto Theme

Note: This is a Fork from 

Flickerd is a [ZenPhoto](http://www.zenphoto.org) theme that is based off of the [Flickrish Theme](http://code.google.com/p/flickrish/) hosted on Google Code. It integrates a photo stream similar to Flickr.com and implements a similar design as well. It is still being developed and I hope to be able to add new features soon.

The *Flickerd Theme* is licensed under the "MIT License":http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php .

# Usage

*PHP 5 Required!*

Refer to ZenPhoto's documentation on how to add and use themes. It works just like a normal theme does.

## Changelog

#### Version 1.0.2

- *GoogleMap Plugin Support* - Added support for the GoogleMap plugin as per request in "Issue 11":https://github.com/amereservant/FlickerdTheme/issues/11 
and added the option *GoogleMap Width* to the _Theme Options_ page.
- *Back-link Added to Sizes View* - As per request in "Issue 9":https://github.com/amereservant/FlickerdTheme/issues/9 , 
a backlink has been added to the image __Sizes__ page.
- *Password Page Design* - As mentioned in "Issue 4":https://github.com/amereservant/FlickerdTheme/issues/4 , 
the page login form didn't have any formatting so it was formatted to match the ZenPhoto login page.
- *Larger Image Preview* - In "Issue 6":https://github.com/amereservant/FlickerdTheme/issues/6 , a request
for a large image layout was made.  The way this was implemented was by adding a **hover** effect so
when the mouse hovers over the thumbnail for at least the *Preview Image Delay* length, a larger image
_(size determined by the *options > theme > Standard options > Image size* value)_ is displayed.
- *CSS Modified* - The width of the content area in the theme was changed for better viewing.
- *Added better Page Titles* - In the head tags, better <title></title> values were added for better search engine ranking.
